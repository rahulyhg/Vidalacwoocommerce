## WooCommerce Product Table vs Product Grid View
*Tables help connect customers to desired products much faster and more surely that grids*

See [[this example](https://wcproducttable.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-29_11-05-37.png)] of table vs grid presentation of the same catalog. You will note that:

* A table view offers a quicker bird’s eye view of the products than a grid layout. The information is easier to absorb in table format.
* Tables allow customers to quickly sort and compare along columns which helps with easier judgement and decision making.
* This leads to better chance of landing a sale with the table UI. Also an advantage over competitors.
* A table view of products can also *supplement* a grid view where appropriate. 

## Displaying product variations in the table
* WCPT Lite offers a popup form to select product variations when a user tried to add a variable product to cart. 
* WCPT PRO offers a ‘Select variation’ element that can display variation option in dropdown or radio buttons inside the table anywhere you choose [[see documentation](https://wcproducttable.com/documentation/select-variation)]
* WCPT PRO also offers a ‘Cart form’ element which displays the product variation form within the table wherever you choose.

## Product add-ons / product extra options
WCPT PRO supports the official [[WooCommerce Product Addons](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-add-ons/?aff=16345)] plugin. This is the only supported product add on plugin right now.

 * Option to download the preview file [[see example](https://wcproducttable.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-28_22-54-15.png)]
 * Powerful mixed search, e.g. search through Track + Artist + Genre
 * Compact audio player that can be placed anywhere on table

## Online restaurant / takeaway menu

* In case a popular plugin you need to use is not compatible, please [[contact support](https://wcproducttable.com/support)]

## Translation
* WPCT PRO is compatible with WPML translation plugin. First you need to translate your WooCommerce products using WPML on your site. Now any WooCommerce content in your table will be automatically translated on the front end via the WPML integration.
* While using WCPT PRO, non-WooCommerce content in your table (like text in custom labels) can also be made translation ready. For this, you can use the shortcode [wcpt_translation default=“text” en_US=“English text” fr_FR=“French text”] anywhere inside the table to make the text translatable.

## Replace shop grid with table
WCPT Lite allows you to create tables through shortcodes which can be placed anywhere on your site that accepts shortcodes. However, this leaves out the archive pages — shop, category, tag, attribute, search. 
To convert the shop or category archive pages you have 2 options:

* **WCPT PRO:** Use the [Archive Override](https://wcproducttable.com/documentation/enable-archive-override) facility available in WCPT PRO. This facility lets you conveniently replace default WooCommerce grids with product tables on all your archive pages — shop, category, tag, attribute, search. The facility is located in WP Dashboard > Product Tables > Settings > Archive Override.
* **WCPT Lite:** The alternative is to create a WCPT grid on a page and then use any WordPress redirect plugin that lets you redirect shoppers from your current shop page to that new shop / category page. However, please note that using this ‘redirect rules’ method may have negative SEO impact as search engines do not prefer such redirect rules.


== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WCPT, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce Product Table” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I replace my default WooCommerce shop grid with a product table? =

There are 2 ways to achieve this:

1. Use the **Archive Override** facility available in WCPT PRO. This facility lets you replace default woocommerce grids with product tables on all your archive pages like Shop / Category / Tag / Attribute. The facility is located in WP Dashboard > Product Tables > Settings > Archive Override. The process is simple and most themes are already compatible. To check if your theme is compatible contact [support](https://wcproducttable.com/support/).

2. The alternative is to use any wordpress redirect plugin that lets you redirect shoppers from yout current shop page to the new shop page you have created with your WCPT table. However, please note that using this 'redirect rules' method can have some SEO impact as search engines do not prefer redirects.

= How do I create a new table? =

You can find full step-by-step tutorials on creating different kinds of tables along with video and annotated screenshots at the [WooCommerce Product Table tutorial](https://wcproducttable.com/tutorials/) page. The process is simple and convenient. Absolutely anyone can follow along with the tutorials.

If you have any issue at all in creating your product table, please feel free to reach out for [support](https://wcproducttable.com/support/) and I will bet happy to help! :)

= Do I have to setup separate columns for laptop, tablet and phone? =

Only Laptop Columns are 'required'. Tablet and Phone Columns are completely optional. Using the Tablet and Phone Columns you can fine-tune the table design for smaller devices. If you leave them empty, they will simply use the same column structure as the device above them ( Laptop > Tablet > Phone ).

= How do I unlock the PRO features? =

You can purchase a license for [WooCommerce Product Table PRO](http://pro.wcproducttable.com) here. It provides [several powerful features](https://www.notion.so/WCPT-PRO-Features-88d026542a2245719a71c33649c3f3d2) to create tables with fantastic user experience. It is available at an introductory price for now, so get it soon!
